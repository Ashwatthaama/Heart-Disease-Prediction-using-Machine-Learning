Logistic Regression algorithm in machine learning to train a model to predict heart disease.

Predicting and diagnosing heart disease is one of the biggest challenge in the medical industry and it relies on factors such as the physical examination, symptoms and signs of the patient. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. Factors that influence heart disease are body cholesterol levels, smoking habit and obesity, family history of illnesses, blood pressure, and work environment. Machine learning algorithms play an essential and precise role in the prediction of heart disease.  Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate. I have used the Logistic regression algorithm for the prediction if heart disease using machine learning.
